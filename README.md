# Disco
A Groovy external client mod for Discord

Compatibility:
| OS | Working? |
|----|----|
| Windows | ‚úÖ (TESTED) |
| Linux | üîú (UNTESTED) |
| OSX | ‚ùì (NEEDS HELP) |

Feel free to PR support for your favorite OS!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Client mods are officially prohibited by Discord. Use this at your own risk! Technically this mod does not modify the client itself, but rather injects javascript code through the built-in electron debugger. To Discord this will most likely still be considered a Client mod!

## Features
- Custom CSS styling
- Hot-Reload for CSS
- Enables "Experiments"

## Limitations
Due to Discord limiting the domains that images may be loaded from, you may encounter issues with external styles or resources. At this moment it's not possible for me to circumvent this, which is actually kind of a good thing, technically!
### Possible workarounds
*Note: None of these have been tested so far, feel free to notify me whether these work! (via GitHub issues or on Discord)*
- Install something like OpenASAR which removes these limitations (You'd now be modifying your client, which is against the goal of this project!)
- Host your resources on Discord's CDN (upload to a private channel and use these links instead, as these are not limited by Discord.)
- Host your resources on your local disk (I do not know whether this may actually work.)
